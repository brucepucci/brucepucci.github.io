# Data Types

---
class: middle

# What are data types?

A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type. We'll talk about 4 today...

* Strings
* Numbers
    * Floating-point Numbers
    * Integers
* Boolean
* None

---
class: middle

# There are many more data types, some of which we will cover later in the course...

* Functions
* Classes
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* ...

# Built-in Functions

The Python interpreter has nearly 70 <sup>nice</sup> "built-in" functions. These are functions you can call without importing or writing them. Full list [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) but some examples are...

```python
>>> abs(-2)
2

>>> min([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
1

>>> type(2)    # Use this to check the type of a value
<class 'int'>

>>> a = 'my string'
>>> type(a)
<class 'str'>
```

---
class: middle

# Numerics

---
class: middle

# In Python there are 2 main numeric types.

* Integers (called *ints*) are whole numbers.
    * -2, 0, 100, 2
* Floating-point numbers (called *floats*) have a decimal point.
    * 3.14, 1.0, -123.45

Unlike other programming languages you do not need to worry if your value will fit into the memory allocated for each data type. (ie. 64bit vs 8bit *ints*)

---
class: middle

# Both numeric types play by a familiar set of mathematical rules.

### PEMDAS still applies in Python.

```python
>>> ((8 + 1) * 5) / 10 + 1
5.5
```

---
class: middle

# Explicit Type Conversion

Some of the built in functions in Python are used to convert from one type to another.

```python
>>> int(3.14) # Always rounds down
3

>>> float(0)
0.0

>>> int('4')
4

>>> int('4.0')   # A bridge too far.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '4.0'

>>> float('4.0')
4.0
```

---
class: middle

# Implicit Type Conversion

Some functions and operators require you to convert types. A couple examples

```python
>>> 2 + 1.14 # Mathematical operation with mixed numeric types
3.14

>>> 2 / 5    # Division between 2 ints
0.4

>>> 10 / 2   # Even if they can evaluate to an int
5.0
```
---
class: middle

# Exercises

```python
>>> float(0) + 1
```
```python
>>> int(5.9) + 1.0
```
```python
>>> int(5) / int(1)
```
```python
>>> int(int(5) / int(1))
```
 
---
class: middle

# Mathematical operators you may not have seen.
 
```python
>>> 10 // 3   # Integer Division: Returns int, throws out remainder
3

>>> 10 % 3    # Modulo, Returns in, only remainder
1

>>> 10 ** 3    # Exponent, 10 to the third power
1000

>>> 10. ** 3    # Expexcted
1000.0
```

---
class: middle

 # More numeric built-ins
 
```python
>>> max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # consumes an `iterable`
5

>>> min([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # consumes an `iterable`
1

>>> sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # consumes an `iterable`
15

>>> round(3.14)
3

>>> round(3.99)
4

>>> round(3.14, 1) # Optional: Takes an 'argument' for # of decimal places to round to
3.1
```

---
class: middle

# Exercises

```python
>>> (25 // 2)
```
```python
>>> float(5 // 2)
```
```python
>>> (13 // 2 * 2) + 13 % 2
```
```python
>>> round(math.pi, 2)     # assume math is imported from standard library
```
```python
>>> a = 10
>>> [1, 2, -2, -1, a]
```

# Strings

---
class: middle

# Strings are a way to store sequences of characters.

### 2 ways to declare a Python string.

* A set of single quotes (')
```python
'Quote me on this.'
```
* A set of double quotes (")
```python
"Quote me on this."
```

# Tip: Quote marks in quotes

You can use the opposite type of quotes if you need to include a quote in a string.
```python
>>> 'It's my favorite quote.'
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    'It's my favorite quote.'
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

>>> "It's my favorite quote."
"It's my favorite quote."
```

You can also use a backslash to "escape" a quote. This allows it to be in a string but prevents Python from interpreting it as the end of a string.
```python
>>> 'It\'s my favorite quote.'
"It's my favorite quote."
```

---
class: middle

# Multi-Line Quotes

Strings within 3 sets of quotation marks (single or double) can continue from line to line

```python
>>> a = """This is a
multi
line
comment.
"""
>>> print(a)
This is a
multi
line
comment.

>>> a
'This is a\nmulti\nline\ncomment.\n'       # Newlines are actually characters... \n

>>> 'These are 		 tabs.'
'These are \t\t tabs.'
```

# Operators and Strings

Operators and strings work relatively intuitively.

```python
>>> 'Where are my keys?' + ' Oh, there they are.'
'Where are my keys? Oh, there they are.'
```

---
class: middle

# The `len()` built in function

To find the number of characters in a string use the `len()` buit-in.

```python
>>> len('Python')
6

>>> len('')
0

```

`len()` has many uses in Python we will cover more in the future.

# Exercises
```python
>>> 'yo' * 3
```
```python
>>> 'Run ' + 'far ' * 2 + 'away.'
```
```python
>>> a = 'It's a me Mario'
```
```python
>>> 'yo' * 10.2
```
```python
>>> 'ðŸ˜Š' * round(6.3)
```
```python
>>> len('ðŸ˜Š') * round(6.3)
```
```python
>>> len(len('ðŸ˜Š') * round(6.3))
```

# Booleans

---
class: middle

# A boolean type takes 1 of 2 values. True or False.

* Name comes from mathematician, George Boole, who studied what's now known as "Boolean Logic".
* They are used to represent the "truthiness" of a statement

---
class: middle

# Boolean Operators

* `and` - Expressions on both sides of operator must be true for `True`
    * `&` is almost exactly the same, don't worry about difference in this course
* `or` - Expressions on either side of operator must be true for `True`
    * `|` is almost exactly the same, don't worry about difference in this course

---
class: middle

# Exercises

```python
>>> (1 == 1) and (1 == 1)
```
```python
>>> (a > b) or (b >= a)   # Assume a & b are numerics
```
```python
>>> ((True or False) and False) and True or False
```
```python
>>> 13 % 2 == 0
```

---
class: middle

# Comparison Operators

* `==` - Expressions on both sides of operator must be equivalent for `True`
    * `is` is almost exactly the same, don't worry about difference in this course
* `!=` - Expressions on both sides of operator must not be equivalent for `True`
    * `is not` is almost exactly the same, don't worry about difference in this course
* `>` - Expressions on left of operator must be greater than right for `True`
* `>=` - Expressions on left of operator must be greater or qual to than right for `True`

---
class: middle

# Exercises

```python
>>> 1 == 1 + 1
```
```python
>>> type(0) == int
```
```python
>>> 'Python' == 'python'
```
```python
>>> len('python') >= len('is fun')
```
```python
>>> print('Hi') == None
```
```python
>>> j = 'hel'
>>> j + 'lo' == 'hello'
```

# Boolean Built-Ins

* `all` - Consumers an *iterable* and if all conditions are true returns `True`
* `any` - Consumers an *iterable* and if any condition is true returns `True`

---
class: middle

# Boolean type conversion in Python

Any non-zero, non-empty string, non-None type values evaluate to True

```python
>>> bool(0)
False

>>> bool(0.0)
False

>>> bool(0.000001)
True

>>> bool('')
False

>>> bool('   ')
True

>>> bool(None)
False
```

---
class: middle

# Exercises

```python
>>> all([True, True, True])
```
```python
>>> any([True & False, False])
```
```python
>>> bool(1.3 * 0.0)
```
```python
>>> bool('' + '')
```
```python
>>> any([None, '', 0, ' '])
```
---
class: middle

# `None` is a representation for the absence of something. If a function returns nothing `None` is assigned.

```python
>>> None == 0
False

>>> None == False
False

>>> None == ''
False

>>> None is None
True
```
