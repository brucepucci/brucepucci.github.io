# Flow Control
### `if` and `while` statements

---
class: middle

# OK, I'm sorry. Those first few classes were rough.

Some of you who haven't coded before might be like...

---
class: middle

# It's gonna be OK. We just need those building blocks.

We know how to run individual statements but we haven't quite yet learned how to compose them in a way that accomplishes useful tasks. That is what we are going to start doing today.

---
class: middle

# So, we need a way to allow us to run certain instructions at certain points.

We might need to skip some lines of code, reference other bits of code, or run something multiple times. After all this is the whole point of doing this... to automate things. We are almost never going to need a program to just run top down, statement by statement.

---
class: middle

# This is where "flow control" comes in.

Flow control statements like the `if` and `while` statements in this class tells Python which instructions to run and when to run them.

---

---
class: middle

# Before we get into `if` we need to talk a little about code blocks and indentation.

Line of Python code that are grouped together to accomplish a task are called "blocks". In Python, unlike any other language, blocks are specified by indentation.

---
class: middle

# Indentation and Python

* A block of code begins with a level of indentation
* Lines of the same block must have the same indentation level
* Blocks end when indentation decreases


---
class: middle

# Indentation and Python (cont.)

* Indentation can either be a certain number of spaces or a certain number of tabs
* Common practice is to use 4 spaces or 1 tab that has 4 spaces of spaces
* It's not a syntax error to use 7 spaces or 16 or even 1. It just looks weird and is hard to read.

---
class: middle

# None of these are syntax errors but use the first one is good practice

```python
def four_spaces():
    a = 1
    b = 2
    return a + b
    
def one_spaces():
 a = 1
 b = 2
 return a + b
    
def sixteen_spaces():
                a = 1
                b = 2
                return a + b
```

---
class: middle

# Exercises

```python
def func_a():
 print('Hello')
 return None
 
def func_b():
  print('Hello')
    return None
  
def func_c():
    print('Hello')
    # return None
      return None
  
def func_d():
    print('Hello')
    return None



```

---
class: middle


# We've seen code blocks before... in the homework.

```python
def exercise_1(a):
    """
    What your solution should do
    """
    return a + 1
    
    
def exercise_2(a):
    """
    What your second solution should do
    """
    a = a + 1
    return a + 1
```

# The `if` statement

---
class: middle

# An if statement executes a block of code is a condition is met.

If the condition is not me the code block that procedes it will be completely skipped.

---
class: middle

# To define an `if` statment you to need to define the following components

* The `if` keyword
    * This has to be the first part of the statement
* A statement that evaluates to a Boolean value (This is called a condition)
    * This immediately follows the `if` keyword
* A colon
    * The colon character in Python states that the code block the follows "belongs" to the preceding statement
* A block of code
    * Remember that a code block must be indented

---
class: middle

# `if` statement example

```python
if 1 > 2:
    print('This will never print')
    
if 1 <= 2:
    print('This will always print')
```
```python
This will always print
```

---
class: middle

```python
if name == "Alice":
    print('Hi, Alice.')
```

![](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/images/000147.jpg)

---
class: middle

# What if we wanted to execute some code if the conditional in the `if` statement were not True?
![](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/images/000118.jpg)

---
class: middle

# We could write 2 `if`s...

```python
name = 'Brian'
if name == "Alice":
    print('Hi, Alice!')
if name != "Alice":                 # Catches everything that isn't 'Brian'
    print('Hello, stranger.')
```

---
class: middle

# Another (more commonly used) option is the `else` statement

`else` is an **optional** block of code that runs if the condition on the `if` statement is False. In other words, if the code block under the `if` statement doesn't run then the `else` block will.

“If this condition is true, execute this code. Or else, execute that code.”

---
class: middle

# `else` example

Defining an else statement is a lot like the `if` statement. You just don't need the conditional.

```python
name = 'Brian'
if name == "Alice":
    print('Hi, Alice!')
else:
    print('Hello, stranger.')
```

# elif

### We have another option in `if` statements, it's called `elif`. It's shorthand for "else if" and is used to give us more than 2 options in the `if` statement.

```python
aapl_share = 318.31

if aapl_share < 270:
    print('Buy Apple')
elif aapl_share > 410:
    print('Sell Apple')
else:
    print('Hold Apple')
```

---
class: middle

# You can have as many `elif` statements as you want.

```python
a = 5

if a == 1:
    print(1)
elif a == 2:
    print(2)
elif a == 3:
    print(3)
elif a == 4:
    print(4)
elif a == 5:
    print(5)
else:
    print(None)
```

---

# If statements run from top to bottom and as soon as 1 condition is met the rest of the if statement is skipped.

# The `while` Loop

---
class: middle

# Loops are a control flow construct used to repetitively run some code.

There are a couple of different ways to loop in Python
* `while` loop
    * Not used commonly
    * Great way to learn about looping
* `for` loop
    * Extremely common
    * Lots of background needed
        * Knowledge of iterables, containers, generators, etc

---
class: middle
# A `while` statement executes a block of code repetitively until a condition is not met.

* The condition is checked at the start of each *iteration* in the loop.

* In English... "While this condition is true execute this code block"

---
class: middle

# To define an `while` statment you to need to define the following components

* The `while` keyword
    * This has to be the first part of the statement
* A statement that evaluates to a Boolean value (This is called a condition)
    * This immediately follows the `while` keyword
* A colon
    * The colon character in Python states that the code block the follows "belongs" to the preceding statement
* A block of code
    * Remember that a code block must be indented

---
class: middle

# Let's compare that last slide to the `if` block definition slide... They are almost the same!

* The `if` keyword
    * This has to be the first part of the statement
* A statement that evaluates to a Boolean value (This is called a condition)
    * This immediately follows the `if` keyword
* A colon
    * The colon character in Python states that the code block the follows "belongs" to the preceding statement

# An example... Spam me!

Buy my stuff!!!
Buy my stuff!!!

# We saw the flow chart for a while loop before...

class: middle

# An infinite loop is a loop that never exits.

### It makes your Python runtime unusable. You application must be killed or interrupted.

```python
name = 'Bruce
while name != 'Cindy':
    print('You're not Cindy')
```

---
class: middle

# How to get out of an infinte loop

* Terminal or IDLE
    * `ctrl-c` on a Mac
    * IDK on Windows. Probably like `ctrl+break` or something
    * You can also just kill or force quit the app
* In Jupyter/Google Colab
    * On title bar: Runtime >> Interrupt Execution

---
class: middle

# To prevent an infinite loop something must change that makes your loop terminable.

It could be...
* A change to a variable
* Time based
* When something happens (When a file lands somewhere or when a webpage is found)
* A `break` statement
* Etc

# The Input Function

The built-in function `input()` asks the user for an input and returns the value entered as a string.

```python
name = input()
print(name)

# The first *argument* to `input()` will describe to your user what to do with the input.

```python
name = input('Enter your name: ')

```python
name = input('What is your name? ')

# Exercises

Write a program that uses a `while` loop to accept integer inputs until a negative number. Then print out the sum of the positive integers.

class: middle

# The `continue` keyword immediately sends us to the next iteration of the loop skipping all remaining code in the block.

The condition will be reevaluated.


```python
i = 0

while i < 20:
    if i % 5 == 0:
        i = i + 1
        continue

# The `break` keyword immediately gets us out of the while loop.

In English... "`break` out of this loop"


```python
i = 0

while True:    # infinite loop
