<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>For this project I will provide you with a dataset and a set of 5 questions to answer. There is no “right answer” to any of the questions however this is genreal gist you should be able to drive towards for each. Your goal is to interpret the question and to the best of your ability code up some reasoning behind your answer. This will require some data manipulation skills and (very) basic statistics and reasoning. What you do to the data is completely up to you… again there are no right answers to any of these. Just demonstrate that you can put resonalble thoughts together in code.</p>
<p>Your submission will be a Jupyter Notebook that executes from top to bottom without an error. You must include some commentary in text around your coded answers. The executable code cells in your notebook is code that supports your answer.</p>
<p>You will probably want to use Pandas for all of this but you are free to solve the problems as you wish.</p>

<p>Most of your grade will not be based on your actual answers but rather on your ability to code in Python and more importantly put together some research using the tools and skills we’ve learned in this course.</p>
