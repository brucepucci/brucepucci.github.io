<h4 id="case-western-reserve-university-weatherhead-school-of-management">Case Western Reserve University, Weatherhead School of Management</h4>
<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>The course will introduce students to the basics of programming logic utilizing the Python programming language and environment. The course will help students understand how to apply programming solutions and related algorithmic thinking to solve common business and decision problems. This class is a great introduction into programming logic, it just happens to use Python. This course will teach the fundamentals of programming logic, which could be applied to any programming language available today or into the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>Attendance</em></strong></p>
<p>Before in-person class cancelations: Notecards with the names of the full roster of the class will be maintained by the instructor. The notecards will be cycled through with an accompanying question for each student. The attendance grade will be (# attempted questions) / (# given questions - 1). For example, if a student is asked 10 in class questions and attempts to answer 9 of them they will get 100% of the attendance points (9 / (10-1)). If a student attempts to answer 5 of 8 given questions the student will receive 71% of the attendance points (5 / (8-1)). You will not receive more than 100% attendance points based on question attempts alone. If you consistently provide quality answers bonus points may be given.</p>
<p>After in-person class cancelations: Attendance will not be taken. Attendance portion of grade will be halved.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quizzes</em></strong></p>
<p>There will be four quizzes throughout the course. These quizzes are designed to measure the student’s comprehension of the material. Quizzes will be <strike>on paper</strike> and may include coding, comprehension, and multiple choice questions. Each quiz should take about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>After in-person class cancelations: Quizzes will be sent out at class start and expected to be returned within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Coding Assignments</em></strong></p>
<p>Students will work independently on each programming exercise. These assignments will attempt to use various types of business datasets. Assignments might involve adjusting existing code, producing new code, producing a file in an automated fashion, or comprehension based questions. Coding assignments will be graded against a set of automated tests for correctness, partial credit will not be given. Questions-Answer type comprehension questions will be graded by the instructor, partial credit is possible on these.</p>
<p><strong><em>Final Project</em></strong></p>
<p>The final project is no longer a group assignment. Each final will need to be submitted individually. I will provide a handful of of data sets and template notebooks for you to fill in. The goal is to tell some kind of story with data. You will need to perform some data transformations, make some visualizations and provide some context as to what is happeneing. An example of what a final might look like can be found <a href="https://github.com/missmariss31/Titanic_iPython">here.</a> The final has decreased in total points from 250 to 150 because of drastically reduced scope.</p>
<h3 id="tentative-class-schedule">Tentative Class Schedule</h3>
<p>Class schedule and due dates are subject to change. Assignment due dates will be provided in class. "Real World" classes may be expanded/removed if previous material runs under/over allotted time. Please let me know if you have a particular interest in one of topics.</p>

<h3 id="cwru-statement-of-ethics">CWRU Statement of Ethics</h3>
<p>Universities seek to preserve, disseminate, and advance knowledge. At CWRU, as elsewhere, we recognize that to fulfill these purposes requires a norm of expected conduct shared by all in the university community, governed by truthfulness, openness to new ideas, and consideration for the individual rights of others, including the right to hold and express opinions different from our own.</p>
<p>The university's mission rests on the premise of intellectual honesty in the classroom, the laboratory, the office, and the solitary examination desk. Without a prevailing ethic of honor and integrity not only in scientific pursuits but also in all scholarly activity, the very search for knowledge is impaired. In these respects, each of us—especially but not exclusively faculty—must regard ourselves as mentors for others.</p>
<p>These principles we strive to uphold make it possible for the larger society to place trust in the degrees we confer, the research we produce, the scholarship we represent and disseminate, and the critical assessments we make of the performance of students and faculty, as well as judgments of staff and administrators.</p>
<p>To safeguard the standards on which we all depend, each of us must, therefore, accept individual responsibility for our behavior and our work and refrain from taking credit for the work of others.</p>
<p>The culture of a university also requires that the rights of all be protected, particularly by those entrusted with authority for judgment of the work of others.</p>
<p>The university being a human community is subject to human failings, ambiguities, and errors. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the bodies regulating the affairs of faculty, students, and staff to maintain processes for judging and resolving instances where these principles may have been violated. However, all such systems depend for their effectiveness, in turn, on the acceptance of common norms of contact—the ties of trust which bind the university community together.</p>
<h3 id="instructor-statement">Instructor Statement</h3>
<p>During the semester I am prepared to meet individually with any and all students enrolled in this course. I would like especially to meet with students with disabilities who are registered with the Disability Resources and who may need individual arrangements.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>All forms of academic dishonesty including cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, obstruction, and submitting without permission work to one course that was completed for another course are violations of academic integrity standards.</p>
<p>Please read the universities policies on academic integrity at <a href="https://bulletin.case.edu/undergraduatestudies/academicintegrity/">https://bulletin.case.edu/undergraduatestudies/academicintegrity/</a>.</p>
