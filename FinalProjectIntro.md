## Groups

If you are in DESN 210 you will work in groups of 3. BTEC 420 students will work alone. Find group assignments [here](http://brucepucci.github.io/groups.html).

## Overview

The project will require you to obtain a data set, manipulate that data and answer some research based question based upon that pre-work. The project will consist of 2 phases.
* Phase 1 - Proposal Paper
The paper will identify the problem, propose a solution, articulate the business requirements and specifications, include a high level flow diagram of the coding logic, and articulate the expected results of the coded solution.
* Phase 2 - A Program in a Jupyter Notebook
The program must support the paper, produce the expected results, and the code must have comments within the final compiled project. In real world scenarios plans change as more details about the data or the problem space becomes clear. This may happen during this project so a revision to the white paper may be submitted with commentary about why the original plan was wrong.

## Phase I - Details

1.  You will be selecting some datasets that you are interested in from virtually any source. I'll provide some good places to look later in these slides.
2.  Form some hypothesis about the data or come up with some interesting questions that you’d like to use the data to answer. This might also be looking for patterns or other relationships in the data.
3.  You will need to design a strategy for how you will prove/show/etc. what you chose in #2. This is where diagramming is useful.

## Phase I - Suggestions

-   You should pick a topic that you are interested in
-   Incremental progress
    -   Start work early and make changes often. Ask me for advice along the way
-   We will learn some basic data scraping techniques but please ask me for help if needed, especially if your data is in format we won't be learning about like RDF, XML, HTML, etc...

## Phase II - Details

You will need to submit a Jupyter Notebook that includes a series of cells that implement the code that was described in the research portion of the notebook. You will also need to include cells that detail what is happening as your notebook runs. Your notebook will need to run from top to bottom without fail.

You will be required to implement some charts and/or graphs as a part of the implementation.

Some of this work will be aided by Pandas and other libraries that we’ll talk about later in the course.

## General Tips in Topic Selection

Get together on how work will be delegated and start looking for a dataset in the near future. It is really helpful to already have an idea or direction before looking at the examples.

When I say idea, I don’t mean “I like sports”. I mean “I want to find a relationship between salaries and the performance of individual athletes vs. teams in baseball”.

## BTEC 420 - Additional Work

I am required to adjust the difficulty/amount of work in the class if you are in the graduate section of this class. 

Thusly, you will be working alone and will be required to combine 2 datasets in some interesting manner. For example, if you find a dataset on 10 year bond rates and another on stock market valuations you might look into the relationships between the 2.
