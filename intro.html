# Some Class Details

* I will try put lecture notes and programming examples on Canvas (probably) at least 24 hours before class. This week will hopefully be the only exception.

* Attendance is required and being engaged in class is very important. The material is cumulative, if you miss parts it will be extremely difficult to catch up.

* I genuinely like helping people learn how to code. Please ask as many questions as you may have. Programming is hard with a lot of gotchas... no question should feel embarrassing or like a waste of time.

* I will try my best to keep things stable, but the schedule is very subject to change. This is my first time working through this material.

* I prefer that you don't use a computer or mobile device to take notes, but you do you. When called upon for participation you will not be allowed to use your device at that time.

# Office Hours

* I do not have an office and I work a full-time job during typical business hours.

* I will make myself as available as possible. Can be through Skype, email, Facetime, whatever the Google thing is, after class, etc. Just ask.

* I might even try to do "coffee shop" hours near the quizzes and final project.

* Last minute questions may not be possible to answer in time.

# A Typical Class Might Look Like...

# Think About Final Projects ASAP

* The final project is the majority of your grade

* Ideas on what the topic of it will come and go, settle into something that interests you

* You are welcome and encouraged to find your own data, but I will provide some places to look for ideas

* If you are in BTEC 420 you will work alone as well as have to find 2 sources of data and combine them in some interesting way

# Tooling

* Python3 (Important that is NOT Python2)
  * [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

* Jupyter Notebooks
  * An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

* Google Colab
  * A Jupyter Notebook host that allows you to write and execute code without messing with setup too much
  * Log in with Case email

# Notecards

* Fill out the front of a notecard with the following information
  1. Name (Optional: What you preferred to be called and preferred pronouns)
  2. Case ID
  3. Major
  4. 1-10 on experience programming
      * 1 = Wut?
      * 10 = Zuckerberg
  5. If you have any experience, what language or tools is it in?
  5. A couple words on why you're here
  6. A couple words on what you want to get out of this class

* After you are done hand me your card and I will attempt to pronounce your name. After you correct me you are free to leave for the day.
