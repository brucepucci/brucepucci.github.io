<p>The reduction in points on the final makes previous quizzes worth relatively more as percentage of your final grade. This may be looked upon as unfair for those of you who maybe did not do well on a previous quiz and wanted to make it up with the final. So, I am going to provide an opportunity for bonus points.</p>
<p>Along with making the final 2 quizzes take home and the new final less work I wanted to provide a way to get some points lost on the previous quizzes back. For an additional 20 percentage points on a previous quiz complete the following assignment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what you learn in this class should improve your productivity in an eventual job or eventual research. Find either a job listing that you are interested in or a research paper in which there is an opportunity to use programming to improve your ability  to perform and write a little bit about it. I will be expecting 1 - 2 pages with specific examples of an area that could be helped by what you’ve either learned in this class or on you own. You can submit this writing on Canvas before Mat 1st at 11:59pm.</p>
